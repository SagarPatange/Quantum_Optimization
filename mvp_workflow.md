# 🚀 Quantum Supply Chain Optimization – MVP + Outreach Plan

This document provides a full breakdown of what we need to do, how to do it, and who is responsible for each part of the project.

---

## 📌 PART I: PROJECT OBJECTIVES

- Create an MVP app that allows small-to-mid-size businesses (SMBs) to upload delivery data and receive optimized routing plans with cost savings.
- Compare classical optimization (e.g. Linear Programming) vs quantum-inspired methods (e.g. QUBO with Simulated Annealing).
- Deliver a clear **before/after cost savings report** + route visual.
- Use real and/or synthetic data to simulate cost reduction.
- Build a simple, clean website to host the MVP and start client outreach.
- Create a pitch deck that shows our value proposition, tech stack, and examples of savings for sample clients.

---

## 📦 PART II: TECH STACK

- **Backend Scripts**: Python (QUBO, LP, Greedy, Simulated Annealing)
- **Visualization**: NetworkX + Matplotlib (already built)
- **Frontend MVP**: Streamlit (for interactivity + file upload + charts)
- **Future Backend (optional)**: Supabase or Firebase if needed
- **Presentation Website**: Static site (HTML/CSS/JS/React or Framer) linked to Streamlit app

---

## 🛠️ PART III: DEVELOPMENT TO-DO LIST (Itemized)

### ✅ A. Backend Scripts (You - Abdurrahman)

#### 1. LP Solver (done)
- Confirm `benchmark_lp.py` is correct and outputs cost
- Output must be parsable for Streamlit (`cost`, `violations`, `assignments`)

#### 2. Greedy Solver (done)

#### 3. QUBO Model with Simulated Annealing (done)
- Test small + medium synthetic datasets
- Add flags to export cost, violations, energy

#### 4. Script: Compare Models (`compare_models.py`)
- Run all solvers
- Output before/after costs and generate `.json` or `.csv` report
- Use subset of synthetic or real data

#### 5. Script: Micro Dataset Generator (`create_micro_data.py`)
- Small testable dataset (3 warehouses × 5 customers)
- Used in debugging + deck visuals

#### 6. Script: PDF/CSV Report Generator
- After model runs, generate downloadable report with:
  - Original costs
  - Optimized costs
  - Constraint violations
  - Suggested assignments
  - Map image

---

### ✅ B. Streamlit App (You)

**File: `app.py`**

#### Core Features:
- 📥 Upload CSVs (warehouses, customers, distances)
- 🧠 Select model: Greedy / LP / QUBO
- 🟢 Button: “Optimize”
- 📉 Output:
  - Before and After Cost
  - Violations
  - Assignment Table
  - Route Visualization (Matplotlib)
- 📄 Download Report (CSV or PDF)

#### Notes:
- Wrap your existing scripts into `run_model(model_type, data_inputs)` format
- Validate input column names
- Add sample data download button
- Use `st.cache_data()` to avoid re-running

---

### ✅ C. Website (Partner’s Guide)

#### 1. Purpose
- Landing page that describes the product
- Hosts the link to the Streamlit app (or embeds it)
- Contact form for leads
- Mobile and desktop friendly

#### 2. Sections to Include:
- Hero: "Save 10–20% on Delivery Costs with AI-Powered Optimization"
- How It Works (3 steps with icons):
  1. Upload your data
  2. Run optimization
  3. Get savings report
- Demo link (embed Streamlit or redirect)
- Case study samples (use deck visuals)
- Pricing (or “Contact Us for Custom Quote”)
- Contact Form

#### 3. Tech Stack:
- Framer, React, or simple HTML/CSS + Netlify
- Embed Streamlit via iframe or external link
- Ensure design is clean + credible (modern fonts, icons)

#### 4. Responsibilities:
- Build static site
- Create 2–3 sample visual cards from scripts you run
- Coordinate with Abdurrahman on visuals + outputs

---

## 🖼️ PART IV: PITCH DECK OUTLINE

#### Slide Structure (10–12 Slides):

1. **Problem** – "SMBs waste 10–25% on last-mile delivery"
2. **Solution** – "AI + quantum-augmented optimization"
3. **How it Works** – Upload CSV → Optimize → Save
4. **Tech Stack** – Python, QUBO, LP, Streamlit
5. **Sample Results** – Before/After costs (LP vs QUBO)
6. **Route Visualization** – Matplotlib output image
7. **Market Opportunity** – Size of SMB delivery/logistics market
8. **Our Ask** – Pilot with 1–2 partners
9. **Roadmap** – Streamlit MVP → API/SaaS → Quantum Scale
10. **Team** – Backgrounds + experience

---

## 💼 PART V: CLIENT OUTREACH PLAN

### A. Ideal First Clients (SMBs with >1 Warehouse + Delivery Network)

| Company | Type | Why Ideal |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Burlington** | Retail | Ship to 100s of stores |
| **Chewy** | Pet products | Complex last-mile |
| **Thrive Market** | Grocery delivery | Optimization = savings |
| **HelloFresh** | Meal delivery | Daily routing complexity |
| **Blue Apron** | Same as above |
| **Medline** | Medical supplies | Warehouse → Hospital delivery |
| **Boxed** | Bulk retail shipping |
| **Shipt (Target)** | Dense network of orders |
| **Bakeries or produce distributors** | Small chains with multiple shops |
| **Regional distributors** | Produce, water delivery, wine, etc. |

---

## 🔚 PART VI: Final Steps to Execute

| Step | Who | Deadline |
|------|-----|----------|
| Finalize all model scripts | Abdurrahman | [Set Date] |
| Build Streamlit app | Abdurrahman | [Set Date] |
| Build website + frontend visuals | Partner | [Set Date] |
| Generate 3–4 test cases w/ visuals | Partner | [Set Date] |
| Create pitch deck | Shared | [Set Date] |
| Begin outreach | Shared | [Set Date] |

---

## 📎 Notes

- All scripts should be callable from Streamlit
- All visuals must be exportable (PDF/PNG for deck)
- Prioritize automation — no manual data cleaning
- Add column name validator for any client-uploaded CSVs
